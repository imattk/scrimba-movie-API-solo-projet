# scrimba-movie-API-solo-projet

- this was a tough one, there are still some parts I need to work on. 
- struggling with saving to localstorage 
- some parts of the code I needed to borrow from other classmates to make mine work. 
- had to go back to some of the videos in the course to figure out how some of it worked again. 
- this was a challange and if I wish I had more time to work on it! but this was a lot harded to work on than a weather app or something
